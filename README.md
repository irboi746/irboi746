- 👋 Hi, I’m @irboi746
- 👀 I’m interested in Digital Forensics, Malware Analysis as well as Pen-testing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes in Pen-testing (eCPPTv2) and eventually OSCP but I am also going into Reverse Engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on eCPPT for now. Eventually, I will also need to develop scripts with python and possible write tools in C or C++.
