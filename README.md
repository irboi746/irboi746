- 👋 Hi, I’m @irboi746
- 👀 I’m interested in many aspects of IT and focused on security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes in Pen-testing (eCPPTv2) and eventually OSCP but I am also going into Digital Forensics and Reverse Engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on eCPPT for now. Eventually, I will also develop scripts with python and possibly write tools in C or C++.
- 📫 How to reach me @ discord irboi746
